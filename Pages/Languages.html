        <p class="text-content">My passion for learning new languages is fueled by both practicality and personal experiences. <br>
            Living in Belgium, improving my Dutch skills is essential for better integration everywhere in my country.<br>
            Following a memorable Erasmus exchange in Norway, I really want to continue learning Norwegian to be able to go back there and have an easier connection with people. <br>
            Overall, I believe language learning opens doors to diverse cultures, facilitates connections worldwide, and prommotes personal growth.<br> <br>
