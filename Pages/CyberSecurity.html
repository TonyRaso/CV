            The CyberSecurityChallenge Belgium is an annual competition designed to identify and develop cybersecurity talent in Belgium.<br>
            Participants, including students, professionals, and enthusiasts, compete in online qualifiers and a final round to showcase their skills in various cybersecurity domains. <br>
