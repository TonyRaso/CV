            The CyberSecurityChallenge Belgium is an annual competition designed to identify and develop cybersecurity talent in Belgium.<br>
            Participants, including students, professionals, and enthusiasts, compete in online qualifiers and a final round to showcase their skills in various cybersecurity domains. <br>
            The challenge serves as a platform for networking with industry professionals and raising awareness about cybersecurity.<br>

            I took part of the 2023 only qualifiers and got the 57th place with my team "NextLevel"<br>
