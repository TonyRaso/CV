            Throughout several seasons, I competed in the second and third divisions of the Benelux's League of Legends league, alongside representing EPHEC in the Belgian Student League. <br>
            These experiences significantly enhanced my teamwork abilities, fostering leadership qualities and refining my collaborative skills.<br>
