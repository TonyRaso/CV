        <p class="text-content">As a last year school project, I developed a website</td>  
            I decided to make a website that would allow League of Legends players to create, simulate and train their draft skills
            I learned to use Riot Games's API and created my very own machine learning algorithm to analyse the odds of winning.
            The website was accessible online, however I shut it down to avoid the cost of running a server.
